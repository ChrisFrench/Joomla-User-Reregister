What if you are just migrating all the users from you awesome forum software from the year 2000 to a joomla system, or you suspect a not so nice person dumped your database file and you want to make all your users change thier passwords.



This script is designed to be run from the commandline

/////
php reregister.php 
////

Zip the plugin folder and install. The force password plugin is a direct download from http://www.sourcecoast.com/extensions, no changes were made to the pluginat all. 

place reregister.php to root of your joomla install and run. 

This could have been a component or something but it seems to be kinda a one off script so i did the bare minimum.
